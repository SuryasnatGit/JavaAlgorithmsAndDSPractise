/**
 * Give a two-dimensional array of Intervals, each of which represents a receiver, and each receiver has a set of
 * intervals. Then give an integer and ask to find all receivers whose interval contains this integer
 *
 * A wants to receive 1 to 4, 7 to 9, 12 to 15 B wants to receive 2 to 8, 10 to 12 C wants to receive 5 to 6 If you give
 * a number 8, it should return A and B If you give a number 5, it should return B and C
 * 
 * Everyoneâ€™s intervals are sorted, so binary search can be used, which is better than brute force
