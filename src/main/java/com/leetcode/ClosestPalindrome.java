/**
 * Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. The 'closest' is defined
 * as absolute difference minimized between two integers.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: "123"
 * 
 * Output: "121"
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = "1"
 * 
 * Output: "0"
 * 
 * Explanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The input n is a positive integer represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18.
 * 
 * If there is a tie, return the smaller one as answer.
