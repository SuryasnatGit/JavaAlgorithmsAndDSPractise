 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: x = 1, y = 4
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation: 1 (0 0 0 1) 4 (0 1 0 0) ↑ ↑
 * 
 * The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

	/**
	 * 477. The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are
	 * different. Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.
	 * 
	 * Example: Input: 4, 14, 2
	 * 
	 * Output: 6
	 * 
	 * Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just showing the four bits
	 * relevant in this case). So the answer will be: HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) +
	 * HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

	 * We can separate the calculation to do one bit at a time. For example, look at the rightmost bit of all the
	 * numbers in nums. Suppose that i numbers have a rightmost 0-bit, and j numbers have a 1-bit. Then out of the
	 * pairs, i * j of them will have 1 in the rightmost bit of the XOR. This is because there are i * j ways to choose
	 * one number that has a 0-bit and one that has a 1-bit. These bits will therefore contribute i * j towards the
	 * total of all the XORs.
	 * 
	 * Apply above algorithm to each bit (31 bits in total as specified in the problem), sum them together then we get
	 * the answer.
