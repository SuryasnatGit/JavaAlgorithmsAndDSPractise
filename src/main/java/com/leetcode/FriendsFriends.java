/**
 * It is known that there is a function that inputs a user ID and can return all the friends (degree 1 friends) of the
 * user, sorted by the friend ID from small to large. It is required to implement a function to output and return the
 * friends of all friends of a user (degree 2 friends), and degree 3 friends
 *
 * Give you a function that can return the current friends with the specified ID, and then use this function to find out
 * which IDs have the most mutual friends other than the two IDs (input) given to you (two levels apart). This is mine.
 * ID and friends' Friend has the most friends in common, because friends are two-way, so just judge how many of my
 * friends are also friends of people on the third level, that is, in-degree, but it is also possible, A-B-C. D is not a
 * friend of A, but D is a friend of C. This is also indegree.
 *
 * My idea: bfs then calculates the in-degree of each layer in the second layer. The one with the most in-degree is the
 * one with the most mutual friends.
 * 
 * https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/54969/fb-08-2016-phone-interview-find-2nd-degree-connections/3
 * 
 * Find 2nd degree connections ( friendsâ€™ friends), output these 2nd degree connections ranked by number of common
 * friends (i.e 1st degree connections) with you, (example: if 2nd degree connection A has 10 common friends (1st degree
 * connections) with you but 2nd degree connection B has 8 common friends (1st degree connections)with you, then A
 * should be ranked first) Input is your connection graph represented by undirected graph nodes, output is list of 2nd
 * degree connections represented by graph nodes
 * 
 * public List<UndirectedGraphNode> findSecDegreeConnections(UndirectedGraphNode myself){
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * you can just apply BFS for two layers and for the node of second layer(2nd degree friends), count the number of 1st
 * degree friends who expand to it. Then just sort the 2nd layer.
 * 
 * Category : Hard
 * 
 * TODO : to check further and understand
