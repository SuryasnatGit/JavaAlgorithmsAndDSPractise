/**
 * A shopkeeper has a sale to complete and has arranged the items being sold in a list. Starting from the left, the shop
 * keeper rings up each item at its full price less the price of the first lower or equally priced item to its right. If
 * there is no item to the right that costs less than or equal to the current item's price the current item is sold at
 * full price.
 * 
 * For example, assume there are items priced [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2]. The first and second items would each be discounted by
 * 1 unit, the first equal or lower price to the right. The item priced 1 unit would sell at a full price. The next
 * item, at 2 units, would be discounted 2 units as would the 4 unit item. The sixth and final item must be purchased at
 * full price. The total cost is 1+2+1+0+2+2 = 8 units.
 * 
 * Print total cost of all items on the first line. On the second line print a space separated list of integers
 * representing the indexes of the non- discounted items in ascending index order.
 * 
 * 1 <= size(prices) <= 100000
 * 
 * 1 <= prices <= 1000000
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * Input 2: [5,1,3,4,6,2]
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * 14
 * 
 * 1 5
 * 
 * Input 3: [1,3,3,2,5]
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * 9
 * 
 * 0 3 4
