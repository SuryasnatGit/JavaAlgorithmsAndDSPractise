 * Find the number of column-swaps required to find the largest rectangle of all ones in a matrix. The question is
 * similar to the one in this link-
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-largest-rectangle-of-1s-with-swapping-of-columns-allowed/
 * 
 * But we need to find the number of minimum swaps required
 * 
 * <a>
 * Given a matrix with 0 and 1’s, find the largest rectangle of all 1’s in the matrix. The rectangle can be formed by swapping any pair of columns of given matrix.
 * 
 * Input: bool mat[][] = { {0, 1, 0, 1, 0},
                        {0, 1, 0, 1, 1},
                        {1, 1, 0, 1, 0}
                      };
Output: 6
The largest rectangle's area is 6. The rectangle 
can be formed by swapping column 2 with 3
The matrix after swapping will be
     0 0 1 1 0
     0 0 1 1 1
     1 0 1 1 0


Input: bool mat[R][C] = { {0, 1, 0, 1, 0},
                         {0, 1, 1, 1, 1},
                         {1, 1, 1, 0, 1},
                         {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
                      };
Output: 9
