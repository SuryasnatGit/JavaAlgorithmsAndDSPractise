/**
 * Given an N-ary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree. A
 * subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a
 * subtree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.
 * 
 * Example 1: Input:
 * 
 * Output: 13 Explanation: For the node with value = 13 we have an avarage of (13 + 4 + -2) / 3 = 5
 * which is the maximum.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * 
 * Output: 21
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * For the node with value = 1 we have an avarage of (- 5 + 21 + 5 - 1) / 5 = 4.
 * 
 * For the node with value = -5 we have an avarage of (-5 / 1) = -5.
 * 
 * For the node with value = 21 we have an avarage of (21 / 1) = 21.
 * 
 * For the node with value = 5 we have an avarage of (5 / 1) = 5.
 * 
 * For the node with value = -1 we have an avarage of (-1 / 1) = -1. So the subtree of 21 is the
 * maximum.
