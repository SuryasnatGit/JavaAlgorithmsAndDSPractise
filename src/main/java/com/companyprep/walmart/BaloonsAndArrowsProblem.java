/**
 * N number of balloons are kept at different heights. You are asked to find out number of arrows to burst them. When an
 * arrow hits the balloon it goes one level down. Assume that the balloons are having same size.
 * 
 * for example given the balloons heights as array(Array will be given in decreasing order of size) : 5 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 1
 * minimum number of arrows to shoot them is: 3
 * 
 * explanation: using first arrow shoot: 5 4 3 2 1 using second arrow shoot: 3 2 1 using third arrow shoot: 1
 * 
 * Example 2: 5 4 2 1
 * 
 * minimum number of arrows to shoot them is: 2 using first arrow shoot: 5 4 using second arrow shoot: 2 1
 * 
 * Expecting the solution to be in O(1) space complexity.
