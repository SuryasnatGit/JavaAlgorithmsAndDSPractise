/**
 * A bad king has a cellar of 1000 bottles of delightful and very expensive wine.
 * 
 * A neighboring queen plots to kill the bad king and sends a servant to poison the wine. Fortunately (or say
 * unfortunately) the bad king’s guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle. Alas, the guards don’t
 * know which bottle but know that the poison is so strong that even if diluted 100,000 times it would still kill the
 * king.
 * 
 * Furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect. The bad king decides he will get some of the prisoners in his vast
 * dungeons to drink the wine. Being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder as less prisoners as possible –
 * believing he can fob off such a low death rate – and will still be able to drink the rest of the wine (999 bottles)
 * at his anniversary party in 5 weeks time.
 * 
 * In the worst case, what is the minimum number of prisoner he would have to kill in order to find out the poisoned
 * bottle? Do note that the king wants to minimize the number of prisoners involved in the experiment. He might decide
 * to kill every prisoner involved in the experiment if he feels that they may tell the world about his evil plans.
 * 
 * 
 * Number the bottles 1 to 1000 and write the number in binary format.
 * 
 * bottle 1 = 0000000001 (10 digit binary) bottle 2 = 0000000010 bottle 500 = 0111110100 bottle 1000 = 1111101000 Now
 * take 10 prisoners and number them 1 to 10, now let prisoner 1 take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in its least
 * significant bit. Let prisoner 10 take a sip from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit. etc.
 * 
 * prisoner = 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 bottle 924 = 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 For instance, bottle no. 924 would be sipped by 10,
 * 9, 8, 5, 4 and 3. That way if bottle no. 924 was the poisoned one, only those prisoners would die. After four weeks,
 * line the prisoners up in their bit order and read each living prisoner as a 0 bit and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit.
 * The number that you get is the bottle of wine that was poisoned.
 * 
 * 1000 is less than 1024 (2^10). If there were 1024 or more bottles of wine it would take more than 10 prisoners to do
 * the experiment.
 * 
 * Now, lets look at the number of prisoners that will die in the worst case. Thats equal to the maximum number of 1
 * bits in numbers from 0 - 999. Number 511 has 9 1 bits. The first number with 10 set bits is 2^10 - 1 = 1023. Since,
 * thats outside our range, the maximum number of prisoners that will die in the experiment is 9.
