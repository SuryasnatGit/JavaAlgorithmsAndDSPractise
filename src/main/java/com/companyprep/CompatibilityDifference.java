/**
 * Two friends Kohli and Dhoni want to test their friendship to check how compatible they are. Given a list of n movies
 * numbered 1,2,3....n and asked both of them to rank the movies. Design an algorithm to find compatibility difference
 * between them.

 * Compatibility difference is the number of mis-matches in the relative rankings of the same movie given by them i.e.
 * if Kohli ranks Movie 3 before Movie 2 and Dhoni ranks Movie 2 before Movie 3 then its a relative ranking mis-match
 * Compatibility difference is the maximum number of mis-matches
 * 
 * Sample Input
