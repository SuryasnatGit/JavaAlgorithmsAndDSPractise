/**
 * Given an undirected graph and a number m, determine if the graph can be colored with at most m colors such that no
 * two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with same color. Here coloring of a graph means assignment of colors
 * to all vertices. Input: 1) A 2D array graph[V][V] where V is the number of vertices in graph and graph[V][V] is
 * adjacency matrix representation of the graph. A value graph[i][j] is 1 if there is a direct edge from i to j,
 * otherwise graph[i][j] is 0. 2) An integer m which is maximum number of colors that can be used.
 * 
 * Output: An array color[V] that should have numbers from 1 to m. color[i] should represent the color assigned to the
 * ith vertex. The code should also return false if the graph cannot be colored with m colors.
 * 
 * The idea is to assign colors one by one to different vertices, starting from the vertex 0. Before assigning a color,
 * we check for safety by considering already assigned colors to the adjacent vertices. If we find a color assignment
 * which is safe, we mark the color assignment as part of solution. If we do not a find color due to clashes then we
 * backtrack and return false.
