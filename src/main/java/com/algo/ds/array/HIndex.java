/**
 * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute
 * the researcher's h-index. https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/.
 * 
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least
 * h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5] Output: 3 Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each
 * of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3
 * citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3. Note: If there are several
 * possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 * 
 * First, you may ask why bucket sort. Well, the h-index is defined as the number of papers with reference greater than
 * the number. So assume n is the total number of papers, if we have n+1 buckets, number from 0 to n, then for any paper
 * with reference corresponding to the index of the bucket, we increment the count for that bucket. The only exception
 * is that for any paper with larger number of reference than n, we put in the n-th bucket.
 * 
 * Then we iterate from the back to the front of the buckets, whenever the total count exceeds the index of the bucket,
 * meaning that we have the index number of papers that have reference greater than or equal to the index. Which will be
 * our h-index result. The reason to scan from the end of the array is that we are looking for the greatest h-index. For
 * example, given array [3,0,6,5,1], we have 6 buckets to contain how many papers have the corresponding index. Hope to
 * image and explanation help.
