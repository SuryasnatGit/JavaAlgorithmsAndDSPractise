/**
 * integer sorting algorithm. <br/>
 * It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key
 * value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of
 * each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the
 * number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key
 * values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the
 * variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items.
 * However, it is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix
 * sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.<br/>
 * Because counting sort uses key values as indexes into an array, it is not a
 * comparison sort, and the Î©(n log n) lower bound for comparison sorting does
 * not apply to it.<br/>
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n+k) where n is the number of elements in input array and
 * k is the range of input. Auxiliary Space: O(n+k)
 *
