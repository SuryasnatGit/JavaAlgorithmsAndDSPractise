/**
 * Magnets are placed linearly, with each magnet to be considered as of point
 * object. each magnet suffers force from its left sided magnets such that they
 * repel it to the right and vice versa. All forces are repulsive. The force is
 * inversely proportional to distance (1/d , d being the distance). Make a
 * function as shown below that takes n as the number of magnets, and array of
 * their distance from origin, which finds all the points along the linear line
 * where net force is ZERO. Distance have to be calculated with precision of
 * epsilon
